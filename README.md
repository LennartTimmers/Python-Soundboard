# Python-Soundboard
A template for a soundboard created with Python. Python is used to create a Flask api which exposes each audio file on their own unique route. The index file includes some Javascript which can dynamically create a button for each audio file found at a route specified in an if statement.


To setup make sure you install the requirements, after that run the main.py file and you'll be good to go!
